<h2><a className="link primary" href="#collect">What information do we collect?</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Basic account information: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture and header image. The username, display name, biography and avatar image are always listed publicly.</li>
	<li>IPs and other metadata: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. All the logged in sessions are available for your review and revocation in the settings. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="use"></a></p>
<h2><a className="link primary" href="#use">What do we use your information for?</a></h2>
<p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide the core functionality of Guac. You can only interact with other people’s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may follow other people to see when they&apos;re live, or write in their chat.</li>
<li>To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.</li>
<li>The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="protect"></a></p>
<h2><a className="link primary" href="#protect">How do we protect your information?</a></h2>
<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. You may enable two-factor authentication to further secure access to your account.</p>
<p><a name="data-retention"></a></p>
<h2><a className="link primary" href="#data-retention">What is your data retention policy?</a></h2>
<p>We will make a good faith effort to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 90 days.</li>
<li>Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12 months.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may irreversibly delete your account at any time.</p>
